asgn4: multithreaded web server

Serves the files that are in the directory the excecutable is in.
Does basically the bare minimum in order to display html. Also will write arbitrary files
to your computer with PUT. So don't use this (on your computer at least lol). Also there were strikes
so I never actually turned in this assignment. It needed a file opening manager in order to prevent
WriteWrite, ReadWrite, or WriteRead collisions. I was part of the way through finishing it.
